            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <h3>Articulate what DACS is (and isn’t), and how its basic principles relate to archival
                theory and practice</h3>
            <h3>Distinguish between minimal and value-added descriptions for archival materials and
                creators</h3>
            <h3>Apply DACS rules to identify and formulate required elements of archival
                description</h3>
            <h3>Integrate DACS across the archival enterprise, in processes such as accessioning,
                arrangement and description.</h3>
            <notes>You’re not going to be DACS experts by the end of the day. But you should feel
                comfortable with using DACS and have some ideas about how it might influence how you
                do things in your repository. Most importantly: You should feel comfortable going
                back to your own repository, analyzing your own practices, and deciding how what
                you’ve learned in this workshop might have an impact on what you do there. </notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
            <h3>Participate</h3>
            <h3>Ask questions</h3>
            <h3>Talk to, learn from and respect your colleagues</h3>
            <notes>Professional colleagues are one of your best resources for thinking about
                archival description, especially implementing new standards. Get to know some
                archivists you don’t already know while you’re here today!</notes>

            <notes>Pass around copy of SAA participant contact list for everyone to check and update
                if needed, especially important if some participants registered after Instructor
                Packet was sent out by SAA Office. Instructor will send to SAA Office after the
                workshop (to insure that people who registered after the Continuing Education
                certificates were sent to the host site get their certificates mailed to them from
                the SAA Office) </notes>

            <h2>Caveats</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">Not a workshop on archival description</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Not a “how-to” for creating finding aids, catalog records or authority
                records</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Not about a right or wrong way of doing things</h3>
            <notes>Other places to go for these things. SAA has an Arrangement and Description
                workshop. There are other modules for creating specific outputs. DACS is not
                prescriptive; above all it requires you to think and to engage. This is a workshop
                on DACS!</notes>

            <h3 class="slide">Can be applied to materials regardless of format</h3>
            <notes>What do we mean when we say "archival description?" We are fundamentally talking
                about an approach to creating and managing information, not a particular kind of
                output! This approach means we describe groups of unique things that are not
                self-describing (they don't have title pages, etc). This means we have to work
                differently than other information professionals; our work necessarily involves
                abstraction and description of context. It also means we have to constantly think of
                our users, which means we have to know who they are. And, even though we are usually
                describing unique materials, archival description can be applied to materials
                regardless of format or origin. Finally, archival description is not just about the
                stuff, it's about describing people and their relationship to records as
                well!</notes>

            <notes>Let's take a moment to talk about descriptive standards. In our context, that
                means a set of rules we use to produce a consistent set of results. There are
                basically three kinds of descriptive standards. Data structure standards define how
                data is structured; they tell you what fields exist and how they relate to each
                other. Data content standards tell you what can go in the fields that are defined by
                data structure standards. And data value standards, often considered a subset of
                data content standards, provide controlled lists of terms.</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h1>A companion standard</h1>
            <notes>DACS is a companion standard. What the heck is a companion standard? This means
                that DACS plays well with other standards like the ones we've just discussed. It is
                flexible enough to be used in conjunction with those standards. You might use rules
                from a more detailed, material-specific standard in lieu of DACS rules for specific
                elements if that form of material is particularly important to your repository. For example, rules
                for the Extent element from The IASA Cataloguing Rules: A Manual for the Description
                of Sound Recordings and Related Audiovisual Media provide much more detail for
                item-level descriptions of sound records than DACS does. If that matters in your
                repository, you can use them instead of the DACS Extent Element (2.5) rules. Or you
                might incorporate elements from other data content standards (e.g., not defined by
                ISAD(G), on which the DACS element set is based) in addition to DACS rules. For example, CCO
                provides elements (and rules for their content) for Style and for Culture that are
                beyond the scope of DACS and might be useful at the series- or item-levels to
                archivists describing cultural object components of the materials of an individual
                or organization</notes>

            <notes>So, this gives you a lot of flexibility, which is awesome. But it also gives you
                a lot of flexiblity, which is problematic. The point of standards is consistency, so
                you need to ensure you're still achieving that goal. Look to best practice
                guidelines (you’re not a special snowflake, someone else has probably encountered
                the same issue as you already!) developed by SAA. Check out some of the other SAA

            <h1>Based on and incorporates ISAD(G)</h1>
            <notes>In addition to being a companion standard, has a closer relationship to an existing
                international standard for archival description. ISAD(G) is intended to be used with
                national standards.</notes>

            <h2>ISAD(G) and DACS</h2>
            <h3>Only five elements are not totally parallel</h3>

                group felt need for this in human-readable form.
                Level of description: Would look odd in finding aids if a separate element, and
                some data structures (EAD, for ex.) handle it. CUSTARD group decided to
                incorporate it as part of the Chapter 1 multi-level minimums
                Physical/Technical access: both there, just separately, in DACS.
                Archival history: CUSTARD group thought the name was weird – so renamed
                it but its content mirrors ISAD(G).
                3 elements to capture what archivists do in creating descriptions?: really, do
                we have any evidence that this is all that important to end users? One element
                seemed like enough for this, and the DACS rules capture the spirit of all 3
                ISAD(G) elements.

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Why this matters</h2>
            <h3>Archival description is increasingly viewed and shared globally. </h3>
            <h3>Shared standards help archivists make description more widely available, and allow
                researchers to understand more easily.</h3>
            <notes>We need to keep in step with international standards because we're not on our
                own. That's why DACS is explicitly tied to ISAD(G).</notes>

            <notes>DACS is output neutral. This means...</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Output neutrality</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">Because it is designed to be used with other standards, DACS does not prescribe one
                specific kind of output.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">DACS can be used to create finding aids, catalog records, digital object metadata
                records, etc.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Allows for data reuse: create description once, output in many ways.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">BUT, it's still all archival description!</h3>
            <notes>You can use DACS rules to create lots of different descriptive outputs. Not just
                finding aids. However, it's still all archival description because, as we just
                talked about, archival description is a way of managing information, not a specific
                kind of output about a specific kind of material.</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Iterative</h1>
            <notes>DACS is iterative. Which means...</notes>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Iteration</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">DACS can and should be used in almost every part of the archival enterprise, including
                accessioning, arrangement, description, reference.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Archival processes are fundamentally iterative and involve accretion of knowledge,
                description, use. DACS accommodates this characteristic of archival functions and
                materials.</h3>
            <notes>Both that it can be used in almost every part of the archival enterprise, but
                also that it can be used whether you're doing extremely detailed item-level
                description, or just minimal collection-level description.</notes>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Accommodates single and multi level descriptions</h1>
            <notes>DACS also accomodates single and multi-level descriptions. This is a bit tricky,
                but basically it means DACS allows you to describe collections at varying levels of
                granularity. Which means you can describe different levels of material (ie
                collection, series, item) at differing levels of detail. So, you can describe
                anything from a single item to an entire collection, and you can describe them in as
                much or as little detail as you want (once you’ve achieved a certain baseline). Note
                that these differing level of records can be created in any output desired.</notes>

            <notes>Everything is numbered, which makes citing a particular rule very easy, and also
                makes you sound like you really know what you're talking about if you drop one of
                the numbers over a cocktail with other archivists.</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Principles of DACS</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">On the nature of archival holdings</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">On the relationship between arrangement and description</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">On the nature of archival description</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">On creators of archival material</h3>
            <notes>You should have looked at these already, but note that these principles are
                divided up into four conceptual groupings. These principles are important, and we're
                going to spend a bit of time going over them. You might think that a lot of these
                are common-sense, and they are, but that doesn't make them any less
                important.</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the nature of archival holdings</h2>
            <h3>Principles 1 and 2</h3>
            <p class="slide">Archival materials have unique characteristics</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="slide">Aggregations of material</li>
                <li class="slide">Created organically through course of business operations or person’s life</li>
                <li class="slide">Intentionally accumulated through interest in some common characteristic such as
                    topic or form of material</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="slide">How these materials were created, maintained and used is important to pass on to
                future users of the records (respect des fonds = provenance + original order)</p>
            <notes>These tell us what we already know; that archival materials are different than
                other kinds of material, and that it's important to pass information about those
                characteristics on to our researchers.</notes>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the relationship between arrangement and description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 3 and 4</h3>
            <p class="slide">
                <strong>Arrangement</strong>: identifying logical groupings as used and maintained
                by the creator of the aggregation, or constructing a useful organization if no
                original one is extant.</p>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Description</strong>: translating that arrangement and other
                important details about the aggregation into an access/use tool useful to both
                archivists and end users</p>
            <notes>Tells us that arrangement and description are related; we also knew this already.</notes>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the nature of archival description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 5, 6 and 7</h3>
            <p class="slide">Principles of archival description apply equally to all records regardless of how and
                who created them, and regardless of form or medium.</p>
            <p class="slide">Archival descriptions can be presented at varying levels of detail in a variety of
                outputs.</p>
            <p class="slide">Levels of description correspond to levels of arrangement; relationships between
                levels must be clearly identified; information provided at each level of description
                should be appropriate for that level.</p>
            <notes>We've talked about a lot of this already when talking about what DACS is. These
                principles are talking about single and multilevel description as well as output
                neutrality.</notes>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On creators of archival material</h2>
            <h3>Principle 8</h3>
            <p class="slide">Archival description is about describing more than just materials. Describing
                creators and their relationship to the materials is crucial to understanding those
                materials.</p>
            <notes>We know this too, but it's important to say; this is basically the reason that Part II exists. Pause for questions.</notes>

            <h1>Development of DACS</h1>
            <notes>I think it's important for us to know where DACS came from; it helps explain some
                of the decisions that were made. And, as archivists, we should love context,
                right?</notes>

                data (and that doesn’t necessarily mean EAC-CPF!) In general, you will find that the
                rules in this section are much more detailed, and often point you to data value
