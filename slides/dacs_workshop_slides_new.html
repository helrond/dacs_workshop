            <h2>Decide, Document, Apply Consistently</h2>
            <notes>Look to best practice guidelines (you’re not a special snowflake, someone else
                has probably encountered the same issue as you already!). Good opportunity to
                mention other modules.</notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Based on and incorporates ISAD(G)</h2>
            <notes>In addition to companion standard, has a closer relationship to an existing
                international standard for archival description. ISAD(G) is intended to be used with
                national standards. </notes>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Comparison chart with ISAD(G) and DACS elements</h2>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Why this matters</h2>
            <p>Archival description is increasingly viewed and shared globally. Shared standards
                help archivists make description more widely available, and allow researchers to
                understand more easily.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Output neutral</h2>
            <p>Because it’s designed to be used with other standards, DACS does not prescribe one
                specific output.</p>
            <p>DACS can be used to create finding aids, catalog records, digital object metadata
                records, etc.</p>
            <p>Data reuse - create description once, output in many ways</p>
            <p>BUT, it’s still all archival description, ie it conforms to principles of archival
                description.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Iterative</h2>
            <p>Can and should be used in almost every part of the archival enterprise, including
                accessioning, arrangement, description, reference.</p>
            <p>Archival processes are fundamentally iterative and involve accretion of knowledge,
                description, use. DACS accommodates this characteristic of archival functions and
                materials.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Accommodates single and multi level descriptions</h2>
            <p>Which means you can describe different levels of material (ie collection, series,
                item) at differing levels of detail. So, you can describe anything from a single
                item to an entire collection, and you can describe them in as much or as little
                detail as you want (once you’ve achieved a certain baseline).</p>

            <h2>On the nature of archival holdings</h2>
            <h3>Principles 1 and 2</h3>
            <p>Archival materials have unique characteristics</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aggregations of material</li>
                <li>Created organically through course of business operations or person’s life</li>
                <li>Intentionally accumulated through interest in some common characteristic such as
                    topic or form of material</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How these materials were created, maintained and used is important to pass on to
                future users of the records (respect des fonds = provenance + original order)</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the relationship between arrangement and description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 3 and 4</h3>
            <p>Arrangement: identifying logical groupings as used and maintained by the creator of
                the aggregation, or constructing a useful organization if no original one is
                extant.</p>
            <p>Description: translating that arrangement and other important details about the
                aggregation into an access/use tool useful to both collection managers (archivists)
                and end users</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the nature of archival description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 5, 6 and 7</h3>
            <p>Principles of archival description apply equally to all records regardless of how and
                who created them, and regardless of form or medium.</p>
            <p>Archival descriptions can be presented at varying levels of detail in a variety of
                outputs.</p>
            <p>Levels of description correspond to levels of arrangement; relationships between
                levels must be clearly identified; information provided at each level of description
                should be appropriate for that level.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On creators of archival material</h2>
            <h3>Principle 8</h3>
            <p>Archival description is about describing more than just materials. Describing
                creators and their relationship to the materials is crucial to understanding those
                materials.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Describing Archival Materials</h2>
            <p>Refer again to “consistent, appropriate, and self-explanatory descriptions of
                archival material”</p>
            <p>Note up-front reference to professional judgement. This does not mean anything goes.
                It means you *can* make certain decisions, but those decisions must be documented
                and then applied consistently.</p>
            <p>We’ll be talking a lot about “elements” - which is just a way of talking about pieces
                of information in a way that doesn’t privilege a certain kind of output or
                encoding.</p>
            <p>We describe starting at the general and moving to the specific. We start with
                information that applies to *everything* in the archival unit being described, and
                then provide more detailed information specific to certain pieces of that unit as
                necessary.</p>

            <h2>2.1 Reference Code</h2>
            <p>Uniquely identifies the archival unit being described, whether it’s a collection or
                an item</p>
            <p>May consist of three subelements</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a local identifier</li>
                <li>a code for the repository</li>
                <li>and a code for the country</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Codes for country and repository should come from data value standards</p>
            <p>Repositories should develop system for identifying units locally</p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>2.2 Name and Location of Repository</h2>
            <p>Pretty self-explanatory, but also important: fundamental to in-person access!</p>
            <p>Good example of the DACS approach to “requiredness” in the rules</p>
            <notes>Rule 2.2.2. “Explicitly state …”: core data content component Rule 2.2.3. “If
                desirable …”: an instruction that may or may not be used; frequently indicated by
                “Optionally …” DACS also uses “Alternatively …” to indicate a parallel approach to
                providing data content </notes>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>2.3 Title</h2>
            <p>A word (infrequently) or a phrase (more likely) by which the archival unit can be
                identified.</p>
            <p>Sometimes material will have formal titles (like a book or an essay). </p>
            <p>Most titles will have to be devised by archivists</p>

            <h2>2.4 Date</h2>
            <p>There are lots of different kinds of dates.</p>
            <p>There is no default kind of date to record (2.4.3), but key is to clearly label what

            <p>Rules for date ranges, predominant or bulk dates</p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>2.5 Extent</h2>
            <p>Can be described either in terms of physical extent (number of boxes, linear feet) or
                material types.</p>
            <p>In each case, record the numerical quantity associated with the extent or material
                type</p>
            <p>Lots of rules for different ways to do multiple, approximate, parallel
                statements.</p>
            <p class="new">Rules for electronic records.</p>
            <p>This is an element that you really need to establish local practice for. Can be

                assembly, accumulation, maintenance of the archival unit</p>
            <p>Should be recorded in a standardized format, from a data value standard like

                <li>Reduce duplication (and potential for errors)</li>
                <li>Linking of one-to-many and many-to-one</li>
                <li>Single point of access for physically disparate materials</li>
                <li>Reduce maintenance</li>
                <li>More structured description of record-creation context</li>
                <li>Can help identify complex entities (name changes, etc)</li>
                <li>Facilitates data exchange</li>

            <h2>What do they contain?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Standardized form of name, variant names (identity)</li>
                <li>History and activities of the entity being described (description)</li>
                <li> Relationships to other entities and information resources (relationships)</li>

            </ul>
            <notes>Traditionally, archivists have presented information about creators within the
                context of description of materials. There’s nothing wrong with that. This part of
                DACS provides guidance for institutions that have a separate system for authority
                data (and that doesn’t necessarily mean EAC-CPF!) In general, you will find that the
                rules in this section are much more detailed, and often point you to data value
                standards as sources of information.</notes>
