            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <h3>Articulate what DACS is (and isn’t), and how its basic principles relate to archival
                theory and practice</h3>
            <h3>Distinguish between minimal and value-added descriptions for archival materials and
                creators</h3>
            <h3>Apply DACS rules to identify and formulate required elements of archival
                description</h3>
            <h3>Integrate DACS across the archival enterprise, in processes such as accessioning,
                arrangement and description.</h3>
            <p class="notes">You’re not going to be DACS experts by the end of the day. But you
                should feel comfortable with using DACS and have some ideas about how it might
                influence how you do things in your repository.<br /> Most importantly: You should
                feel comfortable going back to your own repository, analyzing your own practices,
                and deciding how what you’ve learned in this workshop might have an impact on what
                you do there. </p>

            <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
            <h3>Participate</h3>
            <h3>Ask questions</h3>
            <h3>Talk to, learn from and respect your colleagues</h3>
            <p class="notes">Professional colleagues are one of your best resources for thinking
                about archival description, especially implementing new standards. Get to know some
                archivists you don’t already know while you’re here today!</p>

            <p class="notes">Pass around copy of SAA participant contact list for everyone to check
                and update if needed, especially important if some participants registered after
                Instructor Packet was sent out by SAA Office. Instructor will send to SAA Office
                after the workshop (to insure that people who registered after the Continuing
                Education certificates were sent to the host site get their certificates mailed to
                them from the SAA Office)<br /> Evaluation is important to me and SAA, please be
                honest so we can make this workshop better.</p>

            <h2>Caveats</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">Not a workshop on archival description</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Not a “how-to” for creating finding aids, catalog records or authority
                records</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Not about a right or wrong way of doing things</h3>
            <p class="notes">Other places to go for these things. SAA has an Arrangement and
                Description workshop. There are other modules for creating specific outputs.<br />
                DACS is not prescriptive; above all it requires you to think and to engage. This is
                a workshop on DACS!</p>

            <p class="notes">What do we mean when we say "archival description?" We are
                fundamentally talking about an approach to creating and managing information, not a
                particular kind of output! This approach means we describe groups of unique things
                that are not self-describing (ie they don't have title pages, etc). <br />Because of
                this, we have to work differently than other information professionals; our
                description necessarily involves some abstraction as well as description of context.
                <br />It also means we have to constantly think of our users, which means we have to
                know who they are. <br />It's also important to note that even though we are usually
                describing unique materials, archival description can be applied to materials
                regardless of format or origin. <br />Finally, archival description is not just
                about the stuff, it's about describing people and their relationship to records as
                well!</p>

            <p class="notes">Let's take a step back and talk about descriptive standards. There's a
                handy definition here on the screen. What I want us to focus on is the goal of all
                of this, which is access (not awesome description, even though that's a nice goal
                too). There are basically three kinds of descriptive standards. </p>

            <h1>A companion standard</h1>
            <p class="notes">DACS is a companion standard. What the heck is a companion standard?
                This means that DACS plays well with other standards like the ones we've just
                discussed. It is flexible enough to be used in conjunction with those standards.
                <br />You might use rules from a more detailed, material-specific standard in lieu
                of DACS rules for specific elements if that form of material is particularly
                important to your repository. <br />For example, rules for the Extent element from
                The IASA Cataloguing Rules: A Manual for the Description of Sound Recordings and
                Related Audiovisual Media provide much more detail for item-level descriptions of
                sound records than DACS does. If that matters in your repository, you can use them
                instead of the DACS Extent Element (2.5) rules. <br />Or you might incorporate
                elements from other data content standards (e.g., not defined by ISAD(G), on which
                the DACS element set is based) in addition to DACS rules. For example, CCO provides
                elements (and rules for their content) for Style and for Culture that are beyond the
                scope of DACS and might be useful at the series- or item-levels to archivists
                describing cultural object components of the materials of an individual or
                organization</p>

                <p class="notes">So, this gives you a lot of flexibility, which is awesome. But it also
                gives you a lot of flexiblity, which is problematic. The point of standards is
                consistency, so in order to ensure you're still achieving that goal, you are going
                to need to create local implementation guidelines. So, make decisions, document
                those decisions, and the apply them consistently.<br />Look to best practice
                guidelines (you’re not a special snowflake, someone else has probably encountered
                the same issue as you already!) developed by SAA. Check out some of the other SAA

            <h1>Based on and incorporates ISAD(G)</h1>
            <p class="notes">In addition to being a companion standard, DACS has a closer
                relationship to the existing international standard for archival description.
                ISAD(G) is intended to be used with national standards.<br />Let's talk a bit more
                about ISAD(G).</p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>ISAD(G) and DACS</h2>
            <h3>Only five elements are not totally parallel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name and Location of Repository</li>
                <li>Level of Description</li>
                <li>Physical/Technical Access</li>
                <li>Archival History/Custodial History</li>
                <li>Archivist’s Note/Rules or Conventions/Date(s) of Description/Description
                    Control</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notes">DACS and ISAD(G) are really similar. This is because DACS is based on
                ISAD(G). As we just said, ISAD(G) is intended to be used in conjunction with
                national standards, which is why DACS has retained a very close connection to it.
                <br />There are just a few differences: <br />Name/Location of repository: ISAD(G)
                handles in reference code, CUSTARD group felt need for this in human-readable form.
                <br />Level of description: Would look odd in finding aids if a separate element,
                and some data structures (EAD, for ex.) handle it. CUSTARD group decided to
                incorporate it as part of the Chapter 1 multi-level minimums
                <br />Physical/Technical access: both there, just separately, in DACS.
                <br />Archival history: CUSTARD group thought the name was weird – so renamed it but
                its content mirrors ISAD(G). <br />3 elements to capture what archivists do in
                creating descriptions?: really, do we have any evidence that this is all that
                important to end users? One element seemed like enough for this, and the DACS rules
                capture the spirit of all 3 ISAD(G) elements. </p>

            <h2>Why this matters</h2>
            <h3>Archival description is increasingly viewed and shared globally. </h3>

                researchers to understand more easily.</h3>
            <p class="notes">We need to keep in step with international standards because we're not
                on our own. That's why DACS is explicitly tied to ISAD(G).</p>

            <h2>Output neutrality</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">Because it is designed to be used with other standards, DACS does not
                prescribe one specific kind of output.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">DACS can be used to create finding aids, catalog records, digital
                object metadata records, etc.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Allows for data reuse: create description once, output in many
                ways.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">BUT, it's still all archival description!</h3>
            <p class="notes">You can use DACS rules to create lots of different descriptive outputs.
                Not just finding aids. However, it's still all archival description because, as we
                just talked about, archival description is a way of managing information, not a
                specific kind of output about a specific kind of material.</p>

            <h2>Iteration</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">DACS can and should be used in almost every part of the archival
                enterprise, including accessioning, arrangement, description, reference.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Archival processes are fundamentally iterative and involve accretion
                of knowledge, description, use. DACS accommodates this characteristic of archival
                functions and materials.</h3>
            <p class="notes">Both that it can be used in almost every part of the archival
                enterprise, but also that it can be used whether you're doing extremely detailed
                item-level description, or just minimal collection-level description.</p>

        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Accommodates single and multi level descriptions</h1>
            <p class="notes">DACS also accomodates single and multi-level descriptions. This is a
                bit tricky, but basically it means DACS allows you to describe collections at
                varying levels of granularity. Which means you can describe different levels of
                material (ie collection, series, item) at differing levels of detail. So, you can
                describe anything from a single item to an entire collection, and you can describe
                them in as much or as little detail as you want (once you’ve achieved a certain
                baseline). Note that these differing level of records can be created in any output
                desired.</p>

            <h3 class="slide">On creators of archival material</h3>
            <p class="notes">You should have looked at these already, but note that these principles
                are divided up into four conceptual groupings. These principles are important, and
                we're going to spend a bit of time going over them. You might think that a lot of
                these are common-sense, and they are, but that doesn't make them any less
                important.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the nature of archival holdings</h2>
            <h3>Principles 1 and 2</h3>
            <p class="slide">Archival materials have unique characteristics</p>
            <p class="notes">These tell us what we already know; that archival materials are
                different than other kinds of material, and that it's important to pass information
                about those characteristics on to our researchers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="slide">Aggregations of material</li>
                <li class="slide">Created organically through course of business operations or
                    person’s life</li>
                <li class="slide">Intentionally accumulated through interest in some common
                    characteristic such as topic or form of material</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="slide">How these materials were created, maintained and used is important to
                pass on to future users of the records (respect des fonds = provenance + original
                order)</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the relationship between arrangement and description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 3 and 4</h3>
            <p class="slide">
                <strong>Arrangement</strong>: identifying logical groupings as used and maintained
                by the creator of the aggregation, or constructing a useful organization if no
                original one is extant.</p>
            <p class="slide"><strong>Description</strong>: translating that arrangement and other
                important details about the aggregation into an access/use tool useful to both
                archivists and end users</p>
            <p class="notes">Tells us that arrangement and description are related; we also knew
                this already.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On the nature of archival description</h2>
            <h3>Principles 5, 6 and 7</h3>
            <p class="notes">We've talked about a lot of this already when talking about what DACS
                is. These principles are talking about single and multilevel description as well as
                output neutrality.</p>
            <p class="slide">Principles of archival description apply equally to all records
                regardless of how and who created them, and regardless of form or medium.</p>
            <p class="slide">Archival descriptions can be presented at varying levels of detail in a
                variety of outputs.</p>
            <p class="slide">Levels of description correspond to levels of arrangement;
                relationships between levels must be clearly identified; information provided at
                each level of description should be appropriate for that level.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>On creators of archival material</h2>
            <h3>Principle 8</h3>
            <p class="slide">Archival description is about describing more than just materials.
                Describing creators and their relationship to the materials is crucial to
                understanding those materials.</p>
            <p class="notes">We know this too, but it's important to say; this is basically the
                reason that Part II exists. <br />Those are the principles. Pause for questions.</p>

            <h1>Development of DACS</h1>
            <p class="notes">I think it's important for us to know where DACS came from; it helps
                explain some of the decisions that were made. And, as archivists, we should love
                context, right?</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Describing Archival Materials</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">“Consistent, appropriate, and self-explanatory descriptions of
                archival material”</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Start by describing generally, move to the specific</h3>
            <p class="notes">Let's take a look at the Introduction first. The important things to
                note here: there is an up-front reference to professional judgement. This does not
                mean anything goes. It means you *can* (and must) make certain decisions, but those
                decisions must then be documented and applied consistently. <br />We describe
                starting at the general and moving to the specific. We start with information that
                applies to *everything* in the archival unit being described, and then provide more
                detailed information specific to certain pieces of that unit as necessary.</p>

            <h3 class="slide">May consist of three subelements</h3>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="slide">Codes for country and repository should come from data value
                standards</h3>
            <p class="notes">In the US, this would be MARC Code list for organizations</p>
            <h3 class="slide">Repositories should develop system for identifying units locally</h3>

                numbers</p>

            <h3 class="slide">Pretty self-explanatory, but also important: fundamental to in-person
                access!</h3>
            <p class="notes">Think about what's important for researchers to know. <br />Good
                example of the DACS approach to “requiredness” in the rules</p>

            <h2 class="required">2.3 Title</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">A word (infrequently) or a phrase (more likely) by which the archival
                unit can be identified.</h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Sometimes material will have formal titles (like a book or an essay). </h3>
            <h3 class="slide">Most titles will have to be devised by archivists. There are no rules
                for transcribing formal titles; look to another standard.</h3>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Titles should...</h2>
            <h3 class="slide">Be brief: use other elements for lengthy text</h3>
            <p class="notes">Don't make the title do all the work! Title needs to work as
                citation.</p>
            <h3 class="slide">Not use acronyms, abbreviations or symbols</h3>
            <p class="notes">Many archivists like to use brackets, but DACS does not support this
                practice for the simple reason that they have potentially many different meanings.
                Don't make your researchers have to research your titles.</p>
            <h3 class="slide">Have a name segment</h3>
            <p class="notes">Name segment: person, corporate body or family primarily responsible
                for creating or assembling the materials. Rules that cover multiple creators, name
                changes, etc.</p>
            <h3 class="slide">Have a segment describing the nature of the archival unit</h3>
            <p class="notes">Nature of Archival Unit segment: Generally, papers, records and
                collections. However, other names may be used. As always, document what you decide
                to do, and then do it consistently.</p>
            <h3 class="slide">Have a segment describing the topics covered in the archival</h3>
            <p class="notes">Topics segment: Optional, May be useful when name and form segments
                don’t give users enough information, or are misleading on their own.</p>

            <p class="notes">This part of DACS has been revised and expanded extensively. This is
                largely due to the approval of EAC-CPF as an SAA standard. So let's talk a bit about
                what authority records are and what they do.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Advantages of authority records</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce duplication (and potential for errors)</li>
                <li>Linking of one-to-many and many-to-one</li>
                <li>Single point of access for physically disparate materials</li>
                <li>Reduce maintenance</li>
                <li>More structured description of record-creation context</li>
                <li>Can help identify complex entities (name changes, etc)</li>
                <li>Facilitates data exchange</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notes">As you can see, there are a lot of advantages to using authority
                records. That said, not every institution will have the ability or desire to create
                authority records.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>What do they contain?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Standardized form of name, variant names (identity)</li>
                <li>History and activities of the entity being described (description)</li>
                <li>Relationships to other entities and information resources (relationships)</li>
                <li>Documentation of how the record was created and maintained (control)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="notes">Traditionally, archivists have presented information about creators
                within the context of description of materials. There’s nothing wrong with that.
                This part of DACS provides guidance for institutions that have a separate system for
                authority data (and that doesn’t necessarily mean EAC-CPF!) In general, you will
                find that the rules in this section are much more detailed, and often point you to
                data value standards as sources of information.</p>
