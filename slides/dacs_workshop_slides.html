   <h2>Caveats About This Workshop</h2>
   <p>Our focus today is on DACS-based data inputs and not on the various outputs it supports,
    SO</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We, like DACS, will be output neutral:</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This is not a MARC cataloging workshop</p>
   <p>This is not an EAD workshop</p>
   <p>This is not a local print finding aid workshop</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Caveats About This Workshop</h2>
   <p>This is not an arrangement workshop:</p>
   <ul>
    <li> Archival description is inextricably tied to arrangement</li>
    <li>DACS Statement of Principles: Principle 4: Description reflects arrangement (page xiii)</li>
    <li>So, even though this workshop isnt about arrangement, arrangement issues will be hovering
     over us all day</li>
    <li>Dont be surprised if your post-workshop thinking about DACS leads you to some heavy thinking
     about how you handle arrangement</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Caveats About This Workshop</h2>
   <p>This workshop is not about right and wrong. </p>
   <li>What's "right" in an archival context? </li>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>THE MANTRA: </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Decide how to apply DACS:</li>
    <li>Institutional decision making </li>
    <li>Professional judgment</li>
    <li>Document your decisions</li>
    <li>Apply your decisions consistently </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Wise Words on Archival Description</h2>
   <blockquote><p>Any descriptive program should take into account several questions cogently posed in
    the Report of the Canadian Subject Indexing Working Group: <strong>Who</strong> uses the archives? <strong>What</strong> do users want? <strong>Why</strong> do users want it? <strong>How</strong> do users go about getting it? The answers to those questions can significantly affect the
     nature of archival arrangement and description. They will influence the types of access tools
     provided, the level of description, type of subject, topic, or provenance-based access
     provided, and the delivery methods, such as published guides, online catalogs, or encoded
     finding aids.</p>
    <p><cite>Kathleen Roe, Arranging and describing archives and manuscripts, Chicago: Society of
      American Archivists, 2005. Part of the Archival Fundamentals Series
    II.</cite></p></blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Some More Words on Archival Description</h2>
   <p>Acquiring: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Appraising: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Accessioning: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Processing: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Arranging: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Describing: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Cataloging: Think of the user</p>
   <p>Preserving: Think of the user</p>
   <p> Note that this does not say think only of the user! Other angles of analysis certainly come
    into play, for example legal statutes when appraising government records. Users and use,
    nonetheless, have frequently not served as explicitly considered factors in the performance of
    many archival functions. </p>

  	<h2>Data Standards</h2>
   <p>Data Structure Standards: Containers in which descriptive data are stored</p>
   <p>Data Content Standards: What you put into those containers</p>

   <h2>Overview of DACS</h2>
   <p>DACS is</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A data content standard based on ISAD(G) </li>
    <li> Designed to be used by U.S. archivists with a variety of data structure and other kinds of
     standards</li>
    <li>The most common data structure standards in the U.S. are:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>EAD: Encoded Archival Description (SAA and Library of Congress, 2002)</li>
     <li>MARC21: Machine-Readable Cataloging (Library of Congress and National Library of Canada,
      1999)</li>

   <h2>Comparison of DACS and ISAD(G)</h2>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is output neutral:</p>
   <p>A standard that supports reuse of same data content in a variety of data structures: From the
    printed finding aid for a collection Collection title: Mairzy Doats papers Inclusive dates:
    1928-1972 to the EAD-encoded version of the finding aid that a U.S. archivist might send to her
    regional consortium and to RLGs ArchiveGrid </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is output neutral (continued):</p>
   <p>...to the collection reference in the item-level description,
    encoded in MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema), that she's created for the digital
    facsimile of Mairzys breathtakingly important 1958 letter to the Pope </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is an iterative standard:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Designed to be used by U.S. archivists to capture and formulate descriptive information
     about groupings of archival materials in their current state of arrangement (or lack
     thereof)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The information content for DACS elements can and will change as archival materials move
    through the stages within your repository: Acquiring => Processing => Use </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is a standard that supports:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Single-level description (page 8). </li>
    <li>Descriptions of archival materials at any one level, for example:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>A MARC21 record</li>
     <li>A preliminary accession record</li>
     <li>A collection-level record in a repositorys collections management database</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Multilevel description (page 10). Descriptions of archival materials beginning at one level
     and including at least one sublevel, for example:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>A preliminary or full collection inventory or register (in print or encoded in EAD)</li>
     <li>Multiple linked MARC21 records</li>
     <li>A relational database collection record that encompasses two or more levels of description
     </li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is not a cookie-cutter approach to archival description:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>It frequently points out that an archivists professional judgment is a critical component in
     applying the standard in a given repository context. It recognizes that, as archival
     proessionals, you and your colleagues can best determine how to apply any standard within the
     context of your repository, its mission, its collections, and its primary users</li>
    <li>It frequently offers advice on a variety of possible approaches and encourages archivists to
     pick an approach, consistently apply it, and document it well</li>
    <li>It offers minimum, optimum, and added-value approaches to determining which elements of
     description to include in both single-level and multilevel descriptions </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>DACS is not one-stop shopping for archival description (DACS page 3):</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You might use other content standards and thesauri for some elements, depending on the
     context in which you work, for example:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>LCNAF for the Name of Creator(s) element</li>
     <li>AAT or TGM II for form and genre terms used in the Extent or Scope and Content
      elements</li>
     <li>AACR2 for rules on transcribing formal titles that appear on some archival materials </li>
     <li>Note that citations for all of these standards (and others referred to in this workshop)
      can be found in DACS Appendix B.</li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2> Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>For example, your local processing manual might read:</p>
   <blockquote><p>The AAT has the following scope note for
    the term Correspondence: "Any forms of addressed and written communication sent and received,
    including letters, postcards, memorandums, notes, telegrams, or cables."" Here at the Feverish
    Archives in our collection-level Scope and Content notes (DACS element 3.1), we always use
    correspondence when referring to any of the types of written communication indicated in the AAT
    scope note, with the exception of picture postcards, which we always specifically call out for
    our reference staff and which the AAT defines as: "Postcards having a pictorial image on one
    side." We use the more granular terms for correspondence at the series level or below. </p></blockquote>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <p>You might use rules from a more detailed, material-specific standard in lieu of DACS rules for
    specific elements if that form of material is particularly important to your repository</p>
   <p>Rules for the Extent element from The IASA Cataloguing Rules: A Manual for the Description of
    Sound Recordings and Related Audiovisual Media provide much more detail for item-level
    descriptions of sound records than DACS does. If that matters in your repository, you can use
    them instead of the DACS Extent Element (2.5) rules</p>
   <p>You might incorporate elements from other data content standards (e.g., not defined by
    ISAD(G), on which the DACS element set is based) in addition to DACS rules</p>
   <p>CCO provides elements (and rules for their content) for Style and for Culture that are beyond
    the scope of DACS and might be useful at the series- or item-levels to archivists describing
    cultural object components of the materials of an individual or organization Overview of DACS
    (continued)</p>
   <p>If a certain format of material is a particular focus for your repository, you might abandon
    DACS altogether at the relevant level of description in a multilevel description in favor of a
    more format-specific standard:</p>
   <p>Use DACS for collection-, series-, and file-level descriptions for the bulk of your archival
    materials, but use Graphic Materials to describe a photographs series at the item level </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>In all cases, DACS encourages you to:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Take a well thought out, consistent approach repository-wide</li>
    <li>Document your decisions about application of standards</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Overview of DACS (continued)</h2>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Archival control: material is described according to archival descriptive rules, focusing on
     the contextual relationships between items and on their provenance rather than on bibliographic
     detail. All forms of material can be controlled archivally.</p>
   <p><cite>
    OCLC's Bibliographic Formats and Standards
   </cite></p></blockquote>
   <p>The upshot of this is:</p>
   <p>As long as your approach to controlling/describing your stuff is essentially archival in
    nature, you can base your descriptive practices on DACS and work outward from there</p>
   <p>Archival is an approach to managing information and NOT an essential characteristic of the
    material in question </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>DACS Principles (DACS page xi) Statement of Principles:</h2>
   <p>On the nature of archival holdings (1 and 2)</p>
   <p>On the relationship between arrangement and description (3 and 4) ? On the nature of archival
    description (5,6,7)</p>
   <p>On creators of archival materials (8) </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>DACS Elements</h2>
   <p>We'll focus on the recommended minimum elements for single-level and multilevel description as
    shown in DACS chapter 1, pages 8-11</p>
   <ul>
    <li>First what both require</li>
    <li>Then what else you need for multilevel</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Then well discuss the optional elements</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>The DACS Requirements (Chapter 1, page 7)</h2>
   <p>Requirements are based on the desire to communicate basic information relevant to:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Identifying (and from end user perspective, citing) the material being described</li>
    <li>Setting the context for the accumulation of the material being described</li>
    <li>Stating how and where to access the material being described ? Requirements specify
     particular elements from DACS that should be used in output products (page 7), meaning:</li>
    <li>Thats should be used and not youll do time in archival purgatory if you dont use</li>
    <li>Your usage will depend on the output product(s) you create locally</li>
    <li>If you decide to develop a divergent practice for your repository, youll follow the mantra
     on slide 7 (consider the mantra the REAL requirement) </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Reference Code Element (DACS 2.1, page 13)</h2>
   <p>DACS encourages you to have a means of providing a succinct alphanumeric identifier for each
    of your archival collections that is unique within your repository</p>
   <p>DACS doesnt prescribe a formula for doing this (there are lots of good examples in DACS and
    elsewhere)</p>
   <p>Standardized repository and country code components of the reference code are only useful and
    required when exchanging encoded descriptive outputs (e.g., EAD, MARC) in consortial, national,
    or international settings </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Name and Location of Repository Element (DACS 2.2, page16)</h2>
   <p>DACS requires this element.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Required means using the elements most useful in descriptive outputs created for use by end
     users. You might not use this element when producing internal descriptive outputs for
     collection tracking and management</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Good example of the DACS approach to requiredness in the rules:</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Rule 2.2.2. Explicitly state : core data content component</li>
    <li>Rule 2.2.3. If desirable : an instruction that may or may not be used; frequently indicated
     by Optionally</li>
    <li>DACS also uses Alternatively to indicate a parallel approach to providing data content </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Title Element (DACS 2.3, page 17)</h2>
   <p>Formal titles:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Your professional judgment is required to determine when material being described has a
     formal title and, if it does, when that matters in the context of your archival descriptive
     practices</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Example: You are providing a file-level title for a file comprising a dozen brochures that you
    determine do each have formal titles</p>
   <p>At the file level, you would probably be supplying a title</p>
   <p>If you actually do item-level description within this file, you would probably be transcribing
    a formal title</p>
   <ul>
    <li>DACS doesnt provide rules for transcribing formal titles, since there are many other data
     content standards to which archivists can turn for those rules (e.g., AACR2, Graphic Materials)
     (see rule 2.3.2)</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Title Element (continued)</h2>
   <p>Supplied titles:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The collective nature of archival approaches to description means that archivists primarily
     supply titles because there will rarely be a formal title for those collective
     aggregations</li>
    <li>A supplied title should be brief and uniquely identify the material being described</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Qualified by how/where the title fits into a multilevel descriptive output and also takes
      into consideration the principle of inheritance of information</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Three segments are generally possible in a supplied title (DACS doesnt prescribe an order
     for these segments):</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Name segment</li>
     <li>Nature of the unit being described segment</li>
     <li>Topic of the archival unit segment </li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Title Element (continued)</h2>
   <p>Supplied titles (continued):</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Don't try to make the title do all the work! </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Date Element (DACS 2.4, page 24)</h2>
   <p>Types of dates</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Date(s) of creation (DOC)</li>
    <ul>
     <li>This is the type of date recorded most often by archivists and manuscript catalogers </li>
     <li> Date(s) of record-keeping activity (DORKA)</li>
     <li>When DOC and DORKA are the same, record only the former</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Date(s) of publication</li>
    <ul>
     <li>most often used when describing items</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Date(s) of broadcast ? most often used when describing items </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Date Element (continued)</h2>
   <p>2.4.3. Record dates of creation, DORKA, publication, or broadcast as appropriate to the
    materials being described</p>
   <p>2.4.4. Alternatively record multiple types of dates, labeling each clearly. When recording
    multiple date types, explain each in the Scope and Content Element</p>
   <p>2.4.10-2.4.11. Optional strategies for indicating predominant or bulk dates, or anomalous
    dates </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Extent Element (DACS 2.5, page 29)</h2>
   <p>Two approaches</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Physical extent (items, containers, etc.)</li>
    <li>Material type(s), general or specific</li>
   </ul>
   <p>2.5.3. Record the numerical quantity associated with each expression of physical extent or
    material type</p>
   <p>If you choose to use material type, select your material type terms from a standardized
    thesaurus </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Extent Element (continued)</h2>
   <p>Ways of expressing extent:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Single quantity covering entire extent (2.5.4)</li>
    <li>Single quantity with material type covering entire extent (2.5.5)</li>
    <li>Qualified: Overall expression of entire extent, then important material types highlighted
     (2.5.6)</li>
    <li>Parallel: Two or more ways of expressing the same extent; each expression covers the entire
     extent (2.5.7)</li>
    <li>Multiple single expressions: Each statement highlights a material type; add the expressions
     together to get the overall extent (2.5.8)</li>
    <li>Estimating extent is fine, as long as you clearly indicate that you are doing so (2.5.9)
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Name of Creator(s) Element (DACS 2.6, page 33)</h2>
   <p>Description of context is crucial to archival description; covered in greater detail in Part
    II of DACS</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Rules for choice of creator(s) in Chapter 9</li>
    <li>Rules for constructing names of creators in Part III (Chapters 12-14)</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Based on AACR2 with a few specifically archival enhancements</li>
     <li>Provided in DACS because many archivists dont work in institutions that do AACR2-based name
      authority work </li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Scope and Content Element (DACS 3.1, page 35)</h2>
   <p>Scope and content includes information about the materials being described. Information can
    include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Functions, activities, transactions, processes that generated them</li>
    <li>Documentary forms and intellectual characteristics of them</li>
    <li>Content dates</li>
    <li>Geographic areas to which they pertain</li>
    <li>Subject matter (topics, people, events, organizations) to which they pertain</li>
    <li>Any other information that assists the user in evaluating the relevance of the materials,
     such as completeness, custodial information, document types, whether or not the materials are
     copies, etc. </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Conditions Governing Access Element (DACS 4.1, page 43)</h2>
   <p>Write clear, succinct statement(s)</p>
   <p>Information about restrictions on access might include</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Extent of materials restricted</li>
    <li>Authority for restriction</li>
    <li>Duration of restriction</li>
    <li>Authorized users</li>
    <li>Contact person for further information</li>
   </ul>
   <p>If there are no restrictions, say so </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Languages and Scripts of the Material Element (DACS 4.5, page 54)</h2>
   <p>Acknowledges that we live in a world where international exchange of and access to descriptive
    information is an increasingly real issue</p>
   <p>Inclusion of this element as a minimum requirement recognizes that archivists in the U.S.
    should no longer let English be the tacit assumption in their descriptions, but should state
    information about languages of the materials, regardless of the language(s) </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Further Minimum Requirements for Multilevel Descriptions</h2>

   <h2>A Few Words About Access Points</h2>
   <p>Not an ISAD(G)-based element of archival description</p>
   <p>Will be different in different output systems</p>
   <p>If you are using an output system that supports access points, many elements defined in DACS
    can:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Serve as access points directly (e.g., Name of Creator(s) Element)</li>
    <li>Serve as sources from which to derive access points (e.g., Title Element, Scope and Content
     Element, Immediate Source of Acquisition Element)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The Overview of Archival Description in DACS provides an excellent, succinct tutorial on using
    DACS to derive access points if your system supports them (DACS pages xviii-xxi) </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Introduction to Describing Creators (DACS page 85)</h2>
   <p>Three steps for documenting context: Identify individuals, families, and corporate bodies that
    played a significant role in the creation of the materials (Chapter 9)</p>
   <p>This is the minimum requirement in DACS (see Chapter 1) for documenting context in archival
    descriptions Assemble biographical information about these individuals or families, or data
    about the history, structure, functions, and relationships of the relevant organizations
    (Chapter 10)</p>
   <p>This is an optimum requirement in DACS (see Chapter 1) Render the names of these entities in
    standardized form to facilitate retrieval of this information across descriptions, systems, and
    institutions (Chapters 12-14)</p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Step 1: Identifying Creators (DACS chapter 9, page 89)</h2>
   <p>Step 1: Identify individuals, families, and corporate bodies that played a significant role in
    the creation of the materials</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Name of Creator(s) Element can be recorded at all levels of archival description (9.4)</li>
    <li>Record only names that appear somewhere else in the archival description (9.5); this isnt
     the element youd supply first in describing an archival collection</li>
    <li>Take the name(s) of creators from:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Name segment of the Title Element (9.8)</li>
     <li>Those identified as creators in the Administrative/Biographical History Element (9.9)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>At lower levels in a multilevel description, you have the option of not recording the
     name(s) of creators as a separate element, provided that there is a name segment in the
     supplied title for that level (9.10)</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Step 2: Administrative/Biographical History (DACS chapter 10, page 93)</h2>
   <ul>
    <li> Step 2: Assemble biographical information about those individuals or families (identified
     using Chapter 9), or data about the history, structure, functions, and relationships of the
     relevant organizations</li>
    <li>Use reliable sources, such as the materials themselves or reference works </li>
    <li> Develop a consistent policy for the content, form, and placement of citations for sources
     and for the use of quotations</li>
    <li>As with information in the Name of Creator(s) Element, store this information in descriptive
     tools or in an authority system</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Step 2: Administrative/Biographical History (continued)</h2>
   <p>This information might include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>For individuals or families:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Names (full, married, pseudonyms, popular), dates, profession, titles, geographic locations
      (places of residence or activity)</li>
     <li>Life activities or relationships</li>
     <li>For families, details of relevant parent/child relationships </li>
     <li> Approximate birth and death dates</li>
     <li>Education, organizational affiliations</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For corporate bodies:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Names</li>
     <li>Dates of founding and/or dissolution</li>
     <li>Geographical locations of activity </li>
     <li> Mandates, functions, administrative structure</li>

     <li>Name(s) of chief officers </li>

   <h2>Step 3: Writing Names</h2>
   <p>Step 3: Render names of entities identified in Chapter 9 in standardized form to facilitate
    retrieval across descriptions, systems, and institutions</p>
   <ul>
    <li>This rule chiefly pertains to names youve selected to use as access points to the materials
     being described</li>
    <li>Theres no DACS rule requiring that you standardize names, but doing so is strongly
     recommended to facilitate retrieval across descriptions, systems, and institutions </li>
    <li>Archivists working in non-library settings may find this concept less familiar than
     archivists who routinely work with librarians</li>
    <li>Standardization of names occurs by identifying the authorized form in an authority file, or
     if an authorized form does not exist, using the rules for creating authority forms of
     names</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Step 3: Authority Records (DACS chapter 11, page 105)</h2>
   <p>Authority work is one of the procedures usually undertaken on the way to writing names as
    access points</p>
   <p>Chapter 11 rules are based on the International Standard Archival Authority Record for
    Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF)) and anticipate something like Encoded
    Archival Context (EAC) </p>
   <p>This chapter offers a good overview of the kinds of information you might find in an archival
    authority system </p>
  </section>

  <section class="slide">
   <h2>Step 3: Authority Records (continued)</h2>
   <p>Step 3: Creating Authority Forms of Names</p>
   <ul>
    <li>If you cant find an authority form of the name you want to include as an access point, use
     the rules in DACS chapters 12-14 to create an authority form of the name:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Persons/Families (DACS chapter 12, page 119)</li>
     <li>Geographic Names (DACS chapter 13, page 153)</li>
     <li>Corporate Bodies (DACS chapter 14, page 159)</li>
